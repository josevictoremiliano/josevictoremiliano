### Hi there! 😁

My name is Jose Victor from Brazil (🇧🇷). I am currently studying at IFRN, where I study computer science for the internet, knowing languages like NextJS, React, React Native PHP, JS, Python Django and others.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) (🎮), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music(🎶).

Would you like to find me?
